## Purpose of Analysis

#### The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines is a viable business platform.  Visualizations have been created from data for New York City's Citi Bike program.

## Visualization Results

* ### Checkout times for users

![Checkout times for users](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW14_CitiBike_DSM/blob/main/Resources/images/Checkout%20Time%20for%20Users.png)

This visualization shows that the peak length of trip is 5 minutes.

* ### Checkout Times by Gender

This visualization shows that the peak length of trip for female riders is 6 minutes.

* ### Trips by Weekday per Hour

This visualization shows that the peak weekday time for starting a trip is Thursday in the 6 o'clock PM hour.

* ### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

This visualization shows that the peak weekday time for females to start a trip is also Thursday in the 6 o'clock PM hour.

* ### Trips by Gender by Day of the Week

One thing that can be seen in this visualization is that subscribers signigicantly outnumber "walk up" customers. 

* ### Top Starting Locations

I was surprised to see that no Citi Bike Stations are located inside of Central Park, though it is well surrounded.

* ### Bike Utilization

I thought this graph told an interesting story about the large variaion in how long some bike are used. In order to recreate this after the TripDuration dimension was changes to date/time in Pandas a new calculated field was required.

&nbsp;
## Summary
* #### This analysis shows that bike share programs can be very busy and knowing how the public can utilize this green resource will be a huge advantage in beginning a similar program here in Des Moines.
* #### Areas of further study
  * I think it would be useful to better understand the variation is bike usage to try and better under what is causing this as it could cause some bikes to wear out much faster than others.  I would like to build a visualization that digs deeper and allows for seeing the length of individual rental periods.
  * Another area not explored yet is the ages of riders.  A visualiztion concerning age would allow for proper marketing and perhaps find a way to even out the times and days that the bikes are used.  If it is found that working age riders are not utilizing the service perhaps a discount for seniors could be installed to encourage ridership during off times.
  * I also like the idea and monitoring flow from one part of the city to another.  If bikes are over saturated going to one portino of the city, perhaps Grand Central Station, instilling pricing that benifits riders to pick up bike at Grand Central and move them a cretain distance away would be of a benefit to the program.
&nbsp;
### This is an exciting and benifical program for any city to consider. I hope Des Moines will be able to institute such a program soon!
